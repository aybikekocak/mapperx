I created this HTML code as follows because a form was required for users to log in to the system. The form facilitates email and password entry, and I used the formGroup attribute with a JavaScript framework like Angular for form validation.

I added id, name, and formControlName attributes to the email input field because these attributes are necessary to provide functionality to the form and bind the form control to a property within the component.

Similarly, I included these attributes for the password input field because ensuring users can securely enter their passwords is crucial.

I attached a (click) event handler to the login button because users need the login process to occur when they click this button.

I designed the navigation bar to hide some elements on small screens to enhance the user experience by reducing unnecessary information and complexity.

In the products section, I used this structure to allow users to view products with their respective images and descriptions.

In the profile section, I added a form to enable users to easily update their profile information.

The applicant information section was created to allow users to easily view their basic information, ensuring it is easily accessible.

The attachments section was structured to allow users to easily view and manage the files they have uploaded.

Finally, I used CSS to style the entire page because it's essential for a web page to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
